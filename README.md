# üß± Tetris

Welcome to our Tetris game, a classic puzzle game developed in C++ using the SFML library. Rotate and move falling blocks to create horizontal lines without gaps. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks above it fall down to fill the gap. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

Created by [Matheus Jales](https://github.com/vynijales), [Nathan Gurgel](https://github.com/ntimesgurgel), and [Juhan Deffren](https://github.com/juhanfreitas) for the "2022.02 Computer Programming" course at UFERSA.

## üìö About the Project

This collaborative project was created by Matheus Jales, Nathan Gurgel, and Juhan Deffren. It showcases our skills in C++ and programming fundamentals. This project is a partial requirement for the "2022.02 Computer Programming" course at UFERSA. The main goal of this project is to create a Tetris game using the SFML library. The game is a classic puzzle game that requires the player to rotate and move falling blocks to create horizontal lines without any gaps. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks above it fall down to fill the gap. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.
